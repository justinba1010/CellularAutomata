# CellularAutomata

# Running
javac ConwaySimulation.java && java ConwaySimulation

# Notes
* At the moment the extendability of the Grid class is not implemented, just change variables in the code to make other forms of Cellular Automata.
* The neighborhood functionality isn't fully hashed out, I like the idea, I can't figure out a good way to go about it.
